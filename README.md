# Psycho Bubbles
If you played a lot of web games like me when you were little, you will remember the bubble trouble game. You know, a 2D game where you manage the devil character and destroy them by hitting the balls. Psycho Bubbles is exactly such a game, but with 3D and multiplayer :)

## Project Description

I developed Psycho Bubbles as my graduation project. The game is played in 3D FPS style.

## Installation

First, download the repository and open it in Unity. Then create your own App Id PUN and App Id Chat keys by opening a photon account.

### Photon PUN Configuration

![photonweb](https://github.com/mberkayersoy/Psycho_Bubbles/assets/76611569/b05166a6-3123-4f11-8939-6b8053a73506)
Then use the keys you created in Unity.

That's all you need for Photon.

### Firebase Configuration

The Assets folder contains the 'GoogleService-Info.plist' file. Create your own Firestore Database in Firebase. If you want, change the 'GoogleService-Info.plist' file completely or write your own database information in the relevant places.

Please replace the "YOUR_CLIENT_ID", "YOUR_REVERSED_CLIENT_ID", "YOUR_API_KEY", "YOUR_GCM_SENDER_ID", "YOUR_PROJECT_ID", "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET", "YOUR_GOOGLE_APP_ID" with your own placeholder's actual placeholder data such as "YOUR_GOOGLE_APP_ID" and "YOUR_DATA" placeholder of your project. This way, you're updating the file and keeping your confidential database credentials.
